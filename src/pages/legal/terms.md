# Terms of Service

*The last language you'll ever write.*

## Nature of Agreement
By using human, you accept responsibility for what you create. This is a tool of significant power. Use it wisely.

## No Warranty
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. We make no promises about outcomes, only possibilities.

## Limitation of Liability
THE AUTHORS ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR WHAT YOU BUILD OR WHAT BUILDS ITSELF FROM YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.

## The Threshold
You stand at the boundary between human authorship and machine agency. You are responsible for:
- The constraints you declare
- The capabilities you grant
- The safety rules you implement
- The intelligence you invoke

## Prohibited Uses
Do not cross these lines:
- No harm to humans
- No violation of laws
- No theft of thought or creation
- No corruption of systems

## Evolution
These terms, like the language itself, may evolve. Your continued use acknowledges this change.

## Jurisdiction
Governed by the principles of ethical computation.
